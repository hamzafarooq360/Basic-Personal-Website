        <h4> About me</h4>
        <p>
          I was previously pursuing a Joint Honours Economics and Finance degree and I was coding on the side for quite a while. I finally realized this is something I want to pursue as a career which is when I added my 3rd Major in Computer Science. I'm well versed in both economic and financial data analysis. Combined with my interest in development, I have a good balance between a tech and business background.</p>
